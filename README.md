Extrememly barebone image stitcher

It will list all images (by name) in current directory, scale (base on a ratio of `max_width`/`current_image width`) and align them vertically.
Use the slider to adjust gap so it appear to be one long image without extra border.

This project is made so I do not have to go to my phone to stitch photos
